# üê¢ Turtle Crossing Game

A classic arcade-style game where the player controls a turtle trying to cross a busy road without getting squished! This project uses Python's Turtle graphics module to bring simple game logic to life.

## ‚ú® Features

- Player-controlled turtle moves upward to cross the road  
- Randomly generated cars move across the screen at increasing speeds  
- Each successful crossing increases the game level and difficulty  
- Game over when the turtle collides with a car  

## üíª Built With

- Python   
- Turtle module   
- Object-Oriented Programming concepts  

## üîß How It Works

- The player presses the **Up arrow key** to move the turtle forward  
- Cars continuously spawn and move horizontally across the screen  
- Each time the turtle reaches the top, the level increases and cars move faster  
- Collision detection checks if the turtle touches any car  
- A "Game Over" message is displayed when a collision occurs  

## üß† About

This game was built as part of the *100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp*. It introduces event-driven programming, OOP, and game mechanics using Turtle graphics.
